# Repo of my freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

freeCodeCamps curriculum includes everything from the basic javascript, ES6, data structures up to the algorithm scripting, OOP, functional programming, and more in between.

Here are most but not all of the challenges including basic and intermediate algorithm scripting and also each of the certification projects.

Every file has its link to the challenge and the testing environment.

Code is good enough to pass the tests. Of course, there's cleaning up to do. Most of these can be done better and faster but here they are.
